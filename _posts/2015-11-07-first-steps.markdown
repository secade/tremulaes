I've updated my [about me](/about) section with some specific content about myself instead of the general Jekyll nonsense. There's not a whole lot going on with the site yet... I'm still debating which of my old posts I should port over, and how exactly I want this site to look. I really struggle with picking sensible colors; maybe I should ask for help?
