        <title>New Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I guess I am rebuilding my website… again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except this time, it’s too late to not do it. I’ve published my new site, and thrown away all the old stuff (well, it’s in a separate repo, at least). The first time I attempted this, I got distracted by the beautiful rabbit hole of CSS animations and the inevitable understanding that I’m not particularly skilled at the design-y aspects of building a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got intimidated. I got scared. I got uncomfortable with my inability to build a beautiful, perfectly designed and manicured site from scratch, on my first attempt. So instead, I played around, learned little, and produced nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now? I just question why I should be scared. It’ll all work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new site. Hope you’ll stick around and enjoy it :)&lt;/p&gt;
